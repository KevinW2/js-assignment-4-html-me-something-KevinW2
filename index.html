                  <h2>Where I'm from and Where I live</h2>
                     <p>I was born in Manhasset, New York. Manhasset is a village located in Long Island, but I didn't spend much time there. I moved to Queens shortly after I was born, and I lived in Queens until I was about seven years old. My family and I then moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. I've been living in Charlotte ever since</p>

                  <h4>What I Like to Listen to</h4>
                     <p>I love listening to music. Some of my favorite genres are Rap/Hip Hop, Funk, R&B, and the Blues. I enjoy pretty much every genre, except for pop. And I never was able to get into Reggae that much.</p>
